Amphibian is my second novel. Well; it was actually written between 2007 and 2008, somewhere, submitted and rejected multiple times, and several years ago got a slight re-draft. Couldn't have been much later than 2009\. It then sat like a toad in a pond for years, until Electio Publishing sent me a contract March 2015, and it debuted March 8th 2016\. You can purchase the book at either Electio Publishing's website, or Amazon.com. Here are links there, and to my
